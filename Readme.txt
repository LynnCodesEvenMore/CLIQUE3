CLIQUE3 is a collection of self-written and well-known algorithms for Clique-searching.

It features output to Graphviz .gv-files to visualize the Graphs.
Graphs are constructed either via Nodes and setting Neighbour Lists,
or via an Adjacency Matrix.

The main algorithms are: 
- CL3: Outputs all 3-Cliques
- CLIQUE: Outputs all Cliques of fixed size and below
- del: Successively deletes nodes with lowest degree to output some Clique
